}
\value{
An object returned by \code{ahead::ridge2f} for the forecast,
typically a list including \code{mean} and prediction intervals.
}
\description{
This function performs ridge regression forecasting using attention-based
context vectors as external regressors. Context vectors are computed from
the training data using various attention mechanisms and then used to
enhance the forecast model.
}
\details{
The function works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Split the time series into training and testing sets according to
\code{split_fraction}.
\item Compute attention-based context vectors from the training data using
the specified attention mechanism.
\item Recursively generate forecasts for the testing horizon, updating the
context vectors at each step by:
\itemize{
\item Appending the new forecast to the series
\item Recomputing attention on the extended series
\item Using the updated context vector as external regressor
}
\item Return the final ridge2f model fitted on the testing data.
}

This approach allows the model to leverage temporal dependencies captured
by attention mechanisms, potentially improving forecast accuracy by
incorporating weighted historical information.
