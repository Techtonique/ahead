\arguments{
\item{y}{A multivariate time series object.}

\item{h}{Integer. Forecast horizon. Defaults to 5.}

\item{attention_type}{String specifying the type of attention mechanism.
Options are: "cosine", "exponential", "dot_product", "scaled_dot_product",
"gaussian", "linear", "value_based", "hybrid", "parametric".
Default is "exponential".}

\item{window_size}{Integer parameter for window size (applicable for
"cosine" attention). Defaults to 3.}

\item{decay_factor}{Double for decay factor (applicable for "exponential"
and "hybrid" attention). Defaults to 5.0.}

\item{temperature}{Double for temperature (applicable for
"scaled_dot_product" attention). Defaults to 1.0.}

\item{sigma}{Double for sigma (applicable for "gaussian" attention).
Defaults to 1.0.}

\item{sensitivity}{Double for sensitivity (applicable for "value_based" or
"hybrid" attention). Defaults to 1.0.}

\item{alpha}{Double for alpha (applicable for "parametric" attention).
Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{beta}{Double for beta (applicable for "parametric" attention).
Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{ahead::ridge2f}}
(e.g., lags, lambda_1, lambda_2, nb_hidden, etc.).}
}
\value{
An object returned by \code{ahead::ridge2f} for the forecast,
typically a list including \code{mean} and prediction intervals.
}
\description{
This function performs ridge regression forecasting using attention-based
context vectors as external regressors. Context vectors are computed from
the training data using various attention mechanisms and then used to
enhance the forecast model.
}
\details{
This approach allows the model to leverage temporal dependencies captured
by attention mechanisms, potentially improving forecast accuracy by
incorporating weighted historical information.
